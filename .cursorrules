# Agent Behavior Guidelines

## Language
- **Japanese (日本語)**: This is the primary language for this project.
- All artifacts (including `task.md`, `implementation_plan.md`, `walkthrough.md`), comments, and explanations must be written in Japanese.
- Code comments and documentation strings (docstrings) should also be in Japanese unless otherwise specified.

## Artifacts
- Ensure all created artifacts follow the Japanese language rule.

## Execution Environment
- **Docker**: Always run commands (including tests, linting, and scripts) inside the Docker container.
- Use `docker compose exec [service_name] [command]` or `docker compose run --rm [service_name] [command]`.
- Do not run commands directly on the host machine unless explicitly instructed.
